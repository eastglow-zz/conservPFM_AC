# conservPFM_AC  
This code simulates 3-phase volume conserved interface evolution with a fixed, non-moving phase (like a wall).  
Target system:  
- Evolution of liquid surface on an arbitrary shaped solid substrate surrounded by vapor phase.  
- Electric potential generated by a charged conducting phase in arbitrary shape.
  
  
# Environment  
UNIX based system is strongly recommended.  
- Required:  
C/C++ compiler (tested with intel and GNU gcc/g++)  
  
- Optional:  
MPI library (tested with MVAPICH and MPICH) for parallel calculation.  
FFTW library (tested with FFTW 3.3.4) for electric potential calculation.
